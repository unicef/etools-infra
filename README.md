## eTools backend infrastructure configuration

This repository is meant to help get an etools development
environment up and running.
It is *not* used for any production setup.

### Notes:

Some knowledge of Docker is also extremely helpful. There's a cheatsheet
in this repo at docs/docker-cheatsheet.md.

### Dependencies

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  (version 1.14 or higher)

### Dev Setup

 - Make sure you have dependencies installed

 - Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:unicef/etools-infra.git`

 - Change to the etools-infra directory: `cd etools-infra`

 - Pull necessary images/repos with `make update`, which also builds the
   docker-compose file.

 - Contact the Dev Lead to get your db dump, name it `db1.bz2`
   and add it to: `./db/`.
   You can copy or hardlink it, just don't use a symbolic link as that
   doesn't seem to work.

 - Run: `make run` in the parent folder and wait for it.
   This should restore the database to the db container.

   - ***Note: you will likely see some error messages from the DB saying
     "ERROR: could not open extension control file" or similar.
     This is okay. When you see "etools_backend exited with code 124" and it
     seems to be hung, let it keep running. Eventually you'll start seeing
     more output from the db_1 container.
     Then when you see "etools_db exited with code 1", CTRL-C, wait for all the
     containers to stop, and run `make run` again.***

   - When `make run` is successful, the last thing you'll see is a
     `runserver` startup. Then it'll sit and show the docker logs until you
     kill it. It will not exit on its own.
     You should leave it running, and continue in another
     window.  (see the doc for `docker-compose up`, that's what `run` does.)

 - At this point you could bring migrations up to speed by running
   `make backend_migrations`, but if you restored from a production backup,
   that could take a very long time due to all the schemas and data. In
   that case just keep following these instructions.
   After the first time, `make backend_migrations` can be used more quickly.

 - if you need to rebuild the containers use `make build_run`

 - ***Localhost server should be running on 8082*** - i.e. you can visit the
   web site at http://localhost:8082.

 - To SSH into a web container `make ssh SERVICE=backend`
   (to run `manage.py createsuperuser` or other commands)
   Change `backend` to match the container you want to ssh to

 - The database container should be accesible on the host machine on port
   51322. The port can be changed by passing it as a parameter as follows
   `DB_PORT=68686 make run` commands.

 ```bash
	make ssh SERVICE=backend
	# create super user (choose public schema when asked)
	python manage.py createsuperuser

	# run schema migrations
	python manage.py migrate_schemas --noinput --schema=public

	# open python shell and reduce the number of countries.
        # (This gets rid of all but a few countries.)
	python manage.py shell
	from etools.applications.core.util_scripts import local_country_keep
	local_country_keep()
	quit()

	# run migrations scripts
	python manage.py migrate_schemas --noinput

	# import currencies data
	python manage.py import_exchange_rates

	exit
 ```

Finally, login to localhost:8082/admin/login to finalize setting up your user:

- In the `auth.User` model make sure to set available countries

- In the `users.UserProfile` model, make sure to select a country and/or a
  country override

You should now be able to access frontend apps.

- When you're done working, CTRL-C the `make run` to shutdown the containers.

### Using Repos/Libraries

If you want to work in a particular repo, then edit the `config.cfg` file.
For example, if we want to pull in the `backend` repo, add the following
to the file;

```bash
   backend=repo
```

And then run the following command;

```bash
   make update
```

The repo will be cloned and docker-compose file will be updated.
You can then start the containers with `make run`

If you want to add backend libraries, it follows a similar flow.
For example, if we want to develop on the `unicef-notifictions` library,
add the following to the `config.cfg` file;

```bash
   lib_notification=true
```

And then run the subsequent commands `make update`
Anytime the config file is updated, run the `make update` command


### Clean up/start over

If you want to stop and remove all the containers, images, and volumes that
this tool has created, run:

```bash
    make reallyclean
```

To just remove the containers, run:

```bash
    make remove
```

That *will* delete all data from the docker environments along with everything
else, so backup the database first if you need it.

### Getting latest changes

Getting the latest changes should be a two-step process:

```bash
   make update
   make build_run
```

### Further help/commands

If you want to see what other commands are available just run `make`

### Dev Setup on Windows 10 requirements

 - Enable Hyper-V (PowerShell opened with Administrator rights: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All`)
 - Install Docker for Windows, stable channel: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows
 - Open Docker Settings and add your shared partitions (the one that contains the folder you are gonna install etools)

 - Do `Dev Setup` steps to install the project

### Docker help

See [Docker Cheatsheet](./docs/docker-cheatsheet.md) for some quick tips for working with docker.

### Running the Backend Locally

See [Local Backend Setup](./docs/running-local-backend-tests.md) for instructions on running the backend
not in a docker container, which can be faster/easier to manage.

### Prod-like environ setup

Coming soon...
